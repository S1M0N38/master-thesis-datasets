The tree can grow up to 100 feet tall and its trunk is generally slender and fibrous. The leaves of a palm tree are long and fan-shaped, with a variety of colors ranging from green to blue-grey. The bark is usually smooth but can also be rough and scaly. Palm trees are often utilized in landscaping and gardening due to their unique appearance and ability to withstand hot and sunny climates. They are also commonly associated with coastal regions and are often depicted in artwork, films, and literature as a symbol of relaxation and tranquility."
