                "content": "A pear is a type of fruit that belongs to the Rosaceae family. \nIt has a round and elongated shape with a wider bottom and narrower top. \nThe skin of a pear is typically green or yellow, although some varieties turn reddish-brown as they ripen. \nThe texture of a pear is smooth and firm when picked, but it becomes softer and juicier as it ripens. \nThe inside of a pear features soft, white flesh and a small core of seeds in the center. \nPears are often used in cooking and baking, as well as eaten fresh as a snack. \nThey can be found in grocery stores and at farmers' markets around the world."
