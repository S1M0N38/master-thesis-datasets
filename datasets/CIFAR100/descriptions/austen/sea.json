                "content": "A sea is a continuous body of saltwater that covers a significant portion of the Earth's surface. The color of a sea can range from deep blue to green, and its texture can vary depending on the weather conditions. The surface of a sea can appear smooth like glass in calm conditions, or rough and choppy in stormy weather. The shape of a sea is usually defined by its surrounding land masses, but it can also be affected by tides and currents. Seas are a vital source of food and transportation for humans, and are also important to marine life. They can be found all over the world, from the Caribbean Sea to the Mediterranean Sea and beyond."
