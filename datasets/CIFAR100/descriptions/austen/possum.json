The most common species in the United States, the Virginia opossum, has grayish-brown fur, a pointed face, and black beady eyes. Its fur is thick and woolly, with coarser guard hairs. The possum's body is shaped like a teardrop, with a rounded head, narrow snout, and a long, tapered body. They are mainly nocturnal and can be found in forests, urban areas, and suburban neighborhoods. Possums are often depicted in folklore as sly and cunning animals."
