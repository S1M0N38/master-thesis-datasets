Men come in a vast array of colors, from pale to dark and everything in between. The texture of a man's skin can be smooth, rough, or somewhere in between. A man's face can be characterized by many features, such as a strong jawline, stubble, or a prominent nose. Men are commonly found in various contexts, from the workplace to the home, and from public spaces to private gatherings. The visual characteristics of a man are often used to distinguish him from other gender identities."
