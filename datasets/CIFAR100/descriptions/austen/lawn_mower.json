Lawn mowers come in different sizes and shapes, ranging from small push mowers to large ride-on models. They are commonly used in residential and commercial landscaping settings and can be found in outdoor power equipment stores. Overall, a lawn mower is an essential tool for maintaining the appearance and health of lawns and gardens."
