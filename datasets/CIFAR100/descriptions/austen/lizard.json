The lizard comes in many different colors, from camouflage browns and greens to striking blues and oranges. The texture of its skin is dry and scaly, with a rough feel. Its shape can vary depending on the species, but it often has a flattened, angular appearance. Lizards can be found in various habitats, including deserts, forests, and even urban areas. They are commonly kept as pets and are also featured in mythology and folklore."
