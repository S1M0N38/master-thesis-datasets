                "content": "A shrew is a small, insect-eating mammal with a pointed snout and tiny eyes. They have a slender body, short legs, and a long, thin tail. Shrews range in color from sandy brown to dark gray and have a velvety texture to their fur. Their noses are elongated and flexible, allowing them to probe into narrow crevices in search of prey. Shrews can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. They are active both day and night and are known for their high-pitched vocalizations. Overall, shrews are small, elusive creatures with a unique set of physical and behavioral characteristics."
