                "content": "An oak tree is a tall, deciduous or evergreen tree that belongs to the genus Quercus. Its leaves are usually lobed and its bark is thick and furrowed. The color of a mature oak tree's leaves typically range from dark green to reddish-brown. The trunk is stout and sturdy, with a wide crown of spreading branches. Oak trees are commonly found in forests, parks, and other natural areas. They have a long lifespan, with some species living for hundreds of years. Wood from oak trees is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it a popular choice for furniture, flooring, and construction."
