It is often served in a clear, glass dish to show off the layers. The dessert is usually vibrant in color due to the bright fruits used within it, with a creamy white layer of custard and whipped cream on top. The texture is soft and spongy due to the layers of cake and the smooth custard. A trifle might be found at social gatherings such as birthday parties or wedding celebrations. It is a popular British dessert that has been enjoyed for centuries."
