Gordon Setters have a silky, smooth texture to their fur and long, floppy ears. They have a robust build and a square-shaped head with a defined stop. The coat of the Gordon Setter is long and feathered, with well-defined markings and a glossy shine. These dogs were originally bred for hunting, and are now often used as companion animals. Overall, the Gordon Setter is a regal-looking dog with a loyal and friendly temperament."
