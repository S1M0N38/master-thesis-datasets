The 'kelpie' is often depicted as having a sleek, dark coat and a powerful physique suggesting its supernatural strength. Its mane and tail may be wild and unkempt, suggesting its untamed nature. Its eyes are said to have a hypnotic quality that can lure unwary travelers to their doom. The 'kelpie' is often associated with danger and cautionary tales of its water-dwelling inhabitants. Today, the 'kelpie' continues to be invoked in stories, art and other forms of Scottish cultural expression."
