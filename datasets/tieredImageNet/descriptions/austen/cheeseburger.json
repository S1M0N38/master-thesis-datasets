The patty is usually made from beef, but can also be made from other meats or meat substitutes. The patty is typically grilled or fried, giving it a brown exterior and a juicy texture. The bun is typically white or sesame seed, and is soft and slightly chewy. The cheese is typically melted on top of the patty, adding a creamy and savory flavor. Cheeseburgers are a popular fast food item and can be found at most burger joints and restaurants."
