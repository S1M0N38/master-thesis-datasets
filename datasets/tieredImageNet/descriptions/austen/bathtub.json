                "content": "A bathtub is a large, typically rectangular or oval-shaped container designed for human bathing. It is usually made of materials such as ceramic, acrylic, or enamel-coated cast iron. The exterior of a bathtub may be smooth or textured, with a glossy or matte finish. The interior surface is typically smooth and slippery to the touch. Bathtubs come in a variety of colors and may feature decorative elements such as built-in shelves or jets for a massage-like experience. They are commonly found in bathrooms and are used for relaxing and cleansing the body."
