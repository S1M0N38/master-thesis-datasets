Fur coats can come in a variety of colors, including black, brown, white, and gray. The texture of a fur coat can be soft or coarse, depending on the type of fur used. They tend to have a long and flowing shape, with a full collar and lapels. Fur coats are often associated with luxury and high-end fashion. They can be found in clothing stores, specialty boutiques, and sometimes vintage shops."
