                "content": "An 'espresso' is a small, concentrated coffee drink typically made with finely ground beans and hot water forced through with high pressure. The liquid appears dark, almost black, with a slight crema, or foam, on top. It is typically served in a small ceramic or tempered glass cup, with a capacity of around 2-3 ounces. The drink is commonly associated with Italy and often enjoyed after a meal or as a mid-day pick-me-up. The aroma of an espresso is strong and rich, with notes of roasted coffee beans and a hint of sweetness. The texture is smooth, with a slightly viscous mouthfeel. A well-prepared espresso should have a balanced flavor profile, with notes of bitterness, sweetness, and acidity."
