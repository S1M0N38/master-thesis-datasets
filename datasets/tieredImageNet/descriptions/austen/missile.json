The body of a missile is usually made of durable materials such as metal or composite materials. Missiles typically come in various sizes and shapes, with some being designed for short-range use and others for long-range deployment. They may also come in various colors, depending on the specific purpose and origin. Missiles are often used in military applications, such as air-to-air combat, ground-to-air defense, or surface-to-surface combat."
