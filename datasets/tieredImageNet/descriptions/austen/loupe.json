                "content": "A loupe is a magnifying tool used to view objects with more detail. It is typically a small, handheld device that can be easily maneuvered. Loupes are most commonly used in jewelry making, watchmaking, and in medical and dental examinations. They can come with a variety of magnification strengths, commonly ranging from 5x to 20x. A typical loupe has a circular or oval lens mounted in a metal or plastic frame. The lens is usually convex and made from glass or plastic. Some loupes also feature built-in illumination to enhance visibility. The size and shape of loupes can vary, but most are compact and lightweight for easy portability. The outer casing of a loupe may be made from metal, plastic, or a combination of both."
