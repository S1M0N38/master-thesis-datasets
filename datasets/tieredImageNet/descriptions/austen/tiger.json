Tigers are known for their orange coat with black stripes, although some species have white or golden coats. Their fur has a smooth and sleek texture, and they have long, sharp claws for hunting. Typically, tigers have a muscular and agile build, with a rounded head and long tail. They are mainly solitary animals and can be found in a variety of habitats such as forests and grasslands. In many cultures, tigers represent strength, power, and bravery and are revered as a symbol of royalty."
