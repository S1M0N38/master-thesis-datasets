                "content": "A tiger shark is a large, predatory species of shark typically found in warm ocean waters. It is easily recognized by its distinct, tiger-like stripes on its body. The skin of a tiger shark is rough and covered in small, tooth-like scales called dermal denticles. They have a wide, triangular-shaped head with powerful jaws filled with sharp teeth for hunting prey. Their dorsal fin is tall and pointed with a marked curve. Tiger sharks can grow up to 18 feet long and weigh over 1,400 pounds. They are opportunistic feeders and will eat a wide variety of prey including other sharks, turtles, and sea birds. Tiger sharks are typically found in coastal areas, but can also be found in open ocean waters."
