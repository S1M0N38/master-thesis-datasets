Maillots often feature a low-cut neckline and high-cut legs. They may also have adjustable straps or built-in cups for added support. Maillots are commonly worn by swimmers, divers, and synchronized swimmers during training and competition. Their sleek and streamlined design allows for a greater range of movement in the water. Maillots come in a variety of colors and patterns, from classic black to bold prints."
