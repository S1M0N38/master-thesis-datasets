Their head is square-shaped with a slight stop and they have dark, almond-shaped eyes. Their ears are small and folded over with a triangular shape. Their body is well-proportioned and muscular with a long tail that is often docked. They are known for their friendly and playful temperament and are often used as therapy dogs. Soft-coated wheaten terriers can be found in homes as family pets or in various dog-related competitions such as agility and obedience trials."
