Its skin is typically dark, with coarse, bristly hair that can be brown, black, or grey in color. It has a distinctive snout and robust body, with short, stocky legs relative to its size. The tusks of a wild boar are one of its most prominent features, and are used for self-defense and in fights with other boars. They can be found in a variety of habitats, from dense forests to open grasslands, and are known for their aggressive behavior when threatened. Wild boars are often hunted for their meat and are considered a popular game animal in many regions."
