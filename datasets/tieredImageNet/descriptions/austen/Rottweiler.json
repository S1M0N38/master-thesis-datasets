They are medium to large in size, with a muscular and robust body structure. Their coat is short and glossy, typically black with brown markings on their face, legs, and chest. The head is large and powerful, with a broad and slightly rounded forehead. The ears are medium-sized, drooping down to the sides of their head. Rottweilers have a confident and calm demeanor, often used as guard dogs or police dogs. They can be found in a variety of settings, such as homes, farms, or law enforcement agencies."
