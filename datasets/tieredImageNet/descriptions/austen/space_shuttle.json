It has a distinctive shape with wings and fins that allow it to glide back during reentry. Usually, it is painted in white, black, and gray with a smooth, metallic texture. It is around 56 meters long, with a rectangular body and two solid rocket boosters attached to its sides. On its nose, there is a conical structure where the cockpit and crew cabin are located. A space shuttle is launched from a special platform and is used primarily by NASA for scientific exploration and research missions. It is a symbol of human ingenuity, innovation, and our continued efforts to explore the vast universe around us."
