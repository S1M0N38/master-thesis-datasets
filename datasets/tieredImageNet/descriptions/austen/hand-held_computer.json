It typically features a touch-screen display and a miniature keyboard or stylus for input. The appearance of a hand-held computer can vary, but they are generally rectangular in shape with a screen that takes up most of the device's surface area. Many models feature a sleek and smooth design with a matte finish and come in a range of colors, including black, silver and white. Hand-held computers are often used by professionals who require a portable computing device for on-the-go use, such as businessmen and women, doctors, and students. They can be found in a variety of settings, such as offices, schools, and homes."
