They typically have a long, narrow head with small ears that hang close to the head. Their coat is silky and can come in a range of colors including white, cream, gray, and tan. The borzoi's body is elegant and streamlined, with long, muscular legs and a deep chest. They are often used as coursing dogs and can be found at dog shows and other competitive events. Their distinctive appearance and graceful movement make them a favored breed among aristocracy. The borzoi's refined features and regal demeanor create an impressively dignified presence."
