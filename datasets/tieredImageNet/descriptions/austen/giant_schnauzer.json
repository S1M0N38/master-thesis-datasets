The giant schnauzer has a black, wiry coat that is thick and dense, providing protection from the elements. Their ears are typically cropped and their tails are docked. This breed is often used as a working dog, serving as a guard or police dog. The giant schnauzer is an intelligent and loyal breed, but requires proper training and socialization. They can be found in homes as a family pet or working alongside their human handler in various contexts such as law enforcement or search and rescue."
