The body of a 'dial_telephone' is typically made of plastic or metal and often has a shiny or matte finish. The dial itself is usually circular with raised numbers and a finger stop to ensure accurate dialing. Most 'dial_telephones' have a handle or headset for talking. \nThe device typically has a cord that is attached to both the handset and the body of the telephone. The 'dial_telephone' was widely used before the advent of touch-tone keypads in the mid-20th century, and can still be found in vintage or retro settings. The color of a 'dial_telephone' ranges from black to a metallic finish, while the texture is typically smooth and hard. The shape is typically rectangular with rounded edges."
