                "content": "A swing is a suspended seat typically found in playgrounds or parks. It is used for recreation and enjoyment. The seat is usually made of a smooth and durable material like wood or plastic. The frame of the swing is usually made of metal or wood and can be painted in various colors. A swing can come in different shapes, but most commonly as a rectangular or circular seat. It moves back and forth in a pendulum-like motion, with the rider pushing off from the ground to gain momentum. Swings can provide a sense of freedom and exhilaration for riders of all ages."
