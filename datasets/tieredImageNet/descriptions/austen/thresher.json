                "content": "A thresher is a type of agricultural machine used to separate grains from their stalks. \nIt typically has a large, cylindrical drum that spins rapidly, with teeth or ridges running along its surface. \nThe drum can be made of metal or other durable materials, and is often painted in bright colors, like red or green. \nWhen in operation, a thresher can produce a loud, rhythmic noise, often accompanied by dust and debris. \nThreshers are commonly used on farms during harvest season in order to increase efficiency and reduce labor costs. \nThey can also be found in museums and historical sites as examples of early industrial machinery. \nOverall, the visual characteristics of a thresher include a cylindrical shape, metal or painted construction, and teeth or ridges along its surface."
