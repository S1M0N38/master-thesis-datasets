                "content": "A trimaran is a type of multihull boat that consists of a main hull and two smaller outrigger hulls. The design typically enables the vessel to reach high speeds while remaining stable. The hulls of a trimaran are usually made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or other composite materials. The interior of a trimaran often includes a small cabin or cockpit for the crew. The sails of the boat are typically large and colorful, and are used to catch the wind for propulsion. Trimarans are often used for racing or exploration, and can be found in various bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and oceans. Visually, a trimaran appears sleek and streamlined, with sharp lines and a modern aesthetic."
