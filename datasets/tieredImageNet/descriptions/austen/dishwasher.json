                "content": "A dishwasher is a mechanical device that is designed to clean dishes and other kitchen utensils. It typically consists of a tub or chamber where the dishes are placed, spray arms that distribute water and detergent, and a heating element to dry the dishes. The exterior of a dishwasher can be made from various materials, including stainless steel, plastic, or even wood. It may have a rectangular or curved shape, with a hinged door or pull-out drawers to access the interior. Dishwashers are commonly found in kitchens of restaurants, homes, and other food-related industries. They are a convenient and efficient way to clean large amounts of dishes quickly. Visually, dishwashers can vary in size, shape, and color, but their overall design is geared towards practicality and functionality."
