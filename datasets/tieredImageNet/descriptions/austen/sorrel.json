The leaves of sorrel are green in color and have a smooth texture. The plant can grow up to 1 meter tall and has small clusters of flowers that range in color from red to green. Sorrel can be found growing in gardens or as a wild plant in fields and woodlands. When harvested, sorrel leaves are typically eaten raw in salads or cooked in dishes such as soups and stews.
