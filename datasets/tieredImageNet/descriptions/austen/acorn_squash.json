The skin of the squash is typically dark green, but can also be orange or yellow in color. The interior of the squash is a rich yellow-orange and contains a hollow cavity filled with seeds. Acorn squash has a smooth, firm texture and a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. It is often roasted or baked and used in soups, stews, casseroles, and as a side dish. Acorn squash can be found in grocery stores and farmers' markets during the fall and winter months."
