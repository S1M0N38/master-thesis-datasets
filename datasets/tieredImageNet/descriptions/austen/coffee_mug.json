                "content": "A coffee mug is a cylindrical or conical-shaped vessel designed to hold and drink hot beverages, especially coffee or tea. Usually made of ceramic, porcelain, or glass, a coffee mug can also be made of plastic, metal, or other materials. The surface of a coffee mug is smooth and glazed to prevent liquid from seeping through. Its handle makes it easy to hold and carry, while also preventing the user from burning their hand. A typical coffee mug has a capacity of about 8-12 ounces, but sizes may vary. Coffee mugs can be found in various settings such as homes, offices, cafes, and restaurants, and often feature colorful designs or patterns."
