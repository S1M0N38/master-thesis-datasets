                "content": "A bassoon is a musical instrument that belongs to the woodwind family. Its sound is produced by blowing air through a long, narrow tube, called a bore, that has a curved shape. The body of the bassoon is made of wood and typically has a dark brown color. The instrument has a distinctive shape and features a long, thin tube, called a bocal, and several metal keys and rods. The bassoon has a complex mechanism that allows the musician to produce a wide range of notes. It is commonly used in orchestral music, band ensembles, and sometimes in jazz music. The bassoon is a visually impressive instrument due to its intricate shape and the shiny metal keys and rods."
