The phone is commonly made of metal, with a rectangular body and a long, cylindrical receiver. The phone's body is usually painted in a muted color, such as grey or beige, and may have visible wear and tear. You can find a pay-phone in public areas such as on street corners, in train stations, or outside of convenience stores. Overall, a pay-phone tends to have a utilitarian appearance, reflecting its primary function as a means of communication for the general public."
