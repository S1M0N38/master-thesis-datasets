Typically made of steel or aluminum, it has a circular shape with a hollow center and a rim that supports the tire. The color of a car wheel can vary depending on the material and finish, while the texture may range from smooth to rough. It is often found in a variety of transportation contexts such as automobiles, trucks, and buses. The visual characteristics of a car wheel include its size, shape, spokes, hubcap, lug nuts, and tread pattern of the tire. It is an essential component that plays an important role in the safety and functionality of a vehicle."
