It can typically be found in the Arctic tundra during breeding season and in coastal areas during winter. The bird is characterized by a reddish-brown back and a white underbelly, with black feathering on its face and breast. Its beak is relatively short and straight, and its legs are an olive-yellow hue. The red-backed sandpiper also has a sharp, slender body with a rounded tail. Its feathers have a soft texture and a slightly glossy sheen. This bird is often seen running along the shoreline in search of insects and small crustaceans to eat."
