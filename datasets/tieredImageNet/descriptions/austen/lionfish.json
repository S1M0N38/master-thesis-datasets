                "content": "A lionfish is a venomous marine fish belonging to the Scorpaenidae family. It is native to the Indo-Pacific region but has been introduced to other areas as a result of aquarium release. The lionfish has distinctive red, orange and white stripes on its body, with long, spiny fins that resemble a lion's mane. Its texture is rough and prickly, with spines covering its body. The lionfish's shape is elongated and narrow, with a wide, fan-like tail. They are often found in coral reefs and rocky areas. The venom of a lionfish is highly toxic and can cause intense pain, nausea and other symptoms. The lionfish is a popular species in the aquarium trade, but their invasive tendencies make them a threat to local ecosystems."
