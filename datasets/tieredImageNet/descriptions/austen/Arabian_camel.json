It has a long and curved neck with a single hump on its back. Arabian camels have a coarse and shaggy coat that is typically a shade of brown or beige. Their fur is thick and is made up of both guard hairs and downy undercoat. They have two-toed feet that are adapted to traverse harsh desert landscapes. Arabian camels are primarily used for transportation and as a source of milk, meat, and wool by nomadic peoples across the Middle East and North Africa."
