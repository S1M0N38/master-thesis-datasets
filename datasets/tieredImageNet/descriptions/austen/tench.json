                "content": "A tench is a freshwater fish that belongs to the Cyprinidae family. It typically has an olive-green or brownish color on its back with yellowish-brown or greenish-yellow scales on its sides and belly. Tenches have a slimy texture due to a mucus coating on their skin, which helps protect them from parasites and predators. In terms of shape, they have a stocky body with a rounded head and a small mouth located on the underside of their head. They can grow up to 27 inches in length and weigh up to 15 pounds. Tenches can be found in slow-moving or still freshwater bodies such as rivers, ponds, and lakes, and they prefer to live in areas with plenty of vegetation and soft muddy bottoms."
