It is typically made from the same fabric as the skirt or dress and is often designed to add extra volume to the lower half of the outfit. Overskirts can come in a variety of shapes, such as A-line, pleated, or ruffled. They can be found in a range of colors, from neutral tones to bold hues, and may feature intricate detailing such as embroidery or beading. Overskirts are commonly worn for formal or semi-formal occasions, such as weddings or cocktail parties. They can be paired with a variety of tops and accessories to create a complete outfit."
