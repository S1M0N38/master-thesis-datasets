                "content": "A bassinet is a small, portable bed designed to hold an infant from birth until they are able to sit up. It is typically made with a sturdy frame and a soft, padded sleeping surface. The sleeping surface may be covered with a sheet or blanket and often features a canopy or hood to protect the baby from light and noise. Bassinets may be made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, and plastic, and may feature wheels or handles for easy transport. They are often used in a home setting, but can also be found in hospitals, childcare centers, and other settings where infants are cared for. Overall, a bassinet is a functional and comfortable sleeping option for newborns."
