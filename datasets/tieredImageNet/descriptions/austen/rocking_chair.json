It is often used for relaxation, reading, nursing, or to soothe infants. The design of a rocking chair typically features a high backrest, wide armrests, and a curved seat. Rocking chairs can vary in color, but are often made of wood and have a natural grain texture. They can be found in various environments, such as front porches, living rooms, and nurseries. The motion of a rocking chair is known to promote relaxation and even improve circulation."
