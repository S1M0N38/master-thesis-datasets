A sliding door can be made of glass or wood and has a smooth texture. It typically has a rectangular shape with clean lines. The most common colors for sliding doors are white, brown, and black. Sliding doors are frequently used in modern homes and office buildings. When closed, a sliding door creates a seamless wall that provides privacy and insulation from noise and weather."
