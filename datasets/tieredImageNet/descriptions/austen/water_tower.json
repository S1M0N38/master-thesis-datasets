It is typically cylindrical in shape with a wide base that tapers as it reaches the top. Commonly constructed from steel or concrete, they can range in height from just a few meters to well over 100 meters tall. They are often painted in a light blue or white color and are visible from a distance. Water towers are commonly found in urban and suburban areas and are a vital part of a city's infrastructure to ensure a reliable water supply for the population."
