Ground beetles can vary in size, ranging from 2mm to over 4cm in length. Their bodies are usually dark in color, such as black or dark brown, and they have a shiny appearance. Their wings are hardened and covered by a protective layer, making them tough and durable. Ground beetles can be found in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and gardens. These beetles are known for their ability to run very fast and are often active at night."
