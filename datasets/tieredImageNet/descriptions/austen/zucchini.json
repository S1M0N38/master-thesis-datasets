The zucchini's skin is typically a shade of green, with a smooth and glossy appearance. Its shape is long and cylindrical, with tapered ends. The flesh of a zucchini is firm and white, with small seeds located in the center. Zucchinis are commonly used in culinary dishes such as stir-fries, salads, and soups. They are also often grown in home gardens and can be found in supermarkets and farmers markets throughout the summer months."
