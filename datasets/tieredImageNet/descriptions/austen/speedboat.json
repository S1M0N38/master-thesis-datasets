                "content": "A speedboat is a small, fast motorboat designed for speed and agility. Typically, they are used for recreational activities such as water sports or racing. The appearance of a speedboat can vary, but they are generally slender and streamlined, with a pointed bow and a flat or slightly concave stern. They are usually made of lightweight materials such as fiberglass or aluminum, and often feature bright, eye-catching colors. A typical speedboat has a powerful engine that produces high speeds and maneuverability on the water. Speedboats can be found in a variety of locations, including lakes, rivers, and coastal waters, where they are used for both professional and recreational purposes."
