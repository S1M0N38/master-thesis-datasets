                "content": "A Bernese Mountain Dog is a large breed of dog that originated from Switzerland. They are known for their friendly and affectionate nature, and are often used as therapy dogs. They have a distinctive tricolour coat - predominantly black with brown and white markings - that is thick and wavy. Their fur is soft to the touch and requires regular grooming to prevent matting. Bernese Mountain Dogs have a sturdy build and are well-proportioned, with a broad chest and muscular legs. They are often used as working dogs for tasks such as cart-pulling and herding. Bernese Mountain Dogs are typically found in rural or suburban areas, and are popular pets due to their loyal and gentle personalities."
