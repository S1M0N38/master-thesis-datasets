                "content": "A hammerhead is a type of shark belonging to the Sphyrnidae family. The name comes from the unique shape of their head, which is flat and wide, resembling a hammer. Its skin is rough and covered in small denticles. The color of a hammerhead differs according to its species, but most of them have a grayish-brownish tone. The eyes of a hammerhead are located on the sides of its head, providing it with a wider field of vision. Hammerheads are typically found in warm waters around the world, particularly around coastlines and continental shelves. They are apex predators and have a unique hunting strategy that involves using their wide head to detect prey hidden in the sand."
