It is typically made of waterproof materials such as porcelain, ceramic, or stone. The shape of a washbasin can vary from round to rectangular, and it can come in a variety of colors, including white, beige, or black. The surface of a washbasin often has a smooth texture, making it easy to clean. It is usually installed on a countertop or wall and can be used in both residential and commercial settings. A typical washbasin may have a faucet, drain, and overflow feature, which can vary in size and style depending on the design."
