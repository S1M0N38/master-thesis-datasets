It has rough, scaly skin that ranges from reddish-brown to gray in color. The dragon has long, powerful legs, a distinctive flat head, and a long tail. They primarily inhabit the islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. Komodo dragons are feared predators, known for their sharp teeth and venomous saliva, which aids in killing their prey."
