A typical racer has a sleek and aerodynamic shape, often characterized by a long and slender frame that minimizes wind resistance. The color of a racer can vary widely depending on the purpose and context of the race, but it is often bright and eye-catching to increase visibility. The texture of a racer's surface is typically smooth to reduce drag. It is common for a racer to have specialized features such as tracks or wheels to increase speed. Racers can be found in a wide range of contexts, from athletic competitions to vehicle races to animal races like horse racing. A successful racer is often measured by its speed, agility and endurance, as well as the ability to outmaneuver rivals."
