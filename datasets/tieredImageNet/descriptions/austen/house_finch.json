The male House Finch has a bright red head, while the female has a more subdued gray-brown head. The House Finch has a conical beak that is thick and strong, allowing it to crack open seeds and nuts. The bird has a compact body with short wings and a short tail. The House Finch is a common sight in suburban and urban areas, often seen perched on telephone wires or feeding at birdfeeders. The bird's sweet, twittering song can also be heard throughout its range."
