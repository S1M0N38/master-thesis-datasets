The fence may have a decorative design on top or be left plain. Picket fences are often painted white or left natural for a rustic look. They are commonly found in residential areas, usually surrounding a front yard or garden. Picket fences are associated with traditional decor and evoke a sense of charm and friendliness. Overall, picket fences have a classic and timeless appearance."
