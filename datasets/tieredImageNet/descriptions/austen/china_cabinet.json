It is typically tall and narrow, with glass doors and shelves to showcase its contents. The cabinet is often made from wood or metal, with a finish that complements the surrounding decor. Nobs and handles can be found on the door frames, while legs or a base can provide support. You may find a china cabinet in formal dining rooms, living rooms, or other areas where aesthetic display is given prominence. Overall, a 'china cabinet' is an elegant and refined storage solution for fine china and other decorative items."
