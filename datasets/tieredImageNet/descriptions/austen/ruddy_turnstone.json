                "content": "A ruddy turnstone is a small shorebird that belongs to the family of sandpipers and known for their bright orange-red plumage during breeding season. Its wings are marked with distinct patches of black and white, while the rest of its body is mostly mottled brown and white. They have short, sturdy bills that are slightly upturned at the tip, which they use to pick at rocks and shells for food. Ruddy turnstones are often found along rocky shorelines, where they can be seen flipping over rocks and pebbles in search of small invertebrates. They are also known to breed in subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. In flight, their wings appear to be mostly dark with a white stripe on their inner wing. Overall, ruddy turnstones are distinctive shorebirds with striking colors and unique behaviors."
