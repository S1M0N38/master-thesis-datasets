They are medium to large-sized dogs known for their friendly and loyal nature. The coat of a golden retriever is typically dense, wavy, and comes in shades of gold. They have expressive eyes that are usually dark brown and a broad, friendly face. Their ears are pendant and feathered, giving them a soft and elegant look. The tail of a golden retriever is thick at the base and usually carried with a gentle wag. Golden retrievers make popular family pets and are often used as service dogs due to their gentle temperament and intelligence. They can be found in homes, parks, and various public places around the world."
