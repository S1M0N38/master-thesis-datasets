The bird is characterized by its distinctive red facial shield and yellow-tipped bill. It has a dark blue-blackish head, neck and underparts, while its flanks and upperparts are olive-brown. It has long toes with scalloped edges that help it traverse floating vegetation. It is a common sight in wetlands across Europe, Asia and northern Africa. It is known for its loud, raucous calls and is a skilled swimmer and diver."
