A typical harvester is a large industrial machine, painted in green or yellow color, and shaped like a rectangular vehicle with a long arm that extends to the front. It is equipped with a pointed blade or a sickle, which cuts the grains and crops. Harvester machines have big wheels or tracks with metallic or rubber-like textures that enable them to move easily over muddy terrains. They are often accompanied by a trailer or a container to store the harvested crops and seeds. Overall, harvester machines are crucial for modern agriculture and contribute to efficient crop harvesting."
