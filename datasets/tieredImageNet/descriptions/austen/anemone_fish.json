They are also known as clownfish.\nThey have a distinctive shape with a round body and a flat head.\nTheir color can vary from bright orange to deep red, with white stripes or spots.\nAnemone fish have a symbiotic relationship with sea anemones and often live among the tentacles of these creatures, providing protection from predators in exchange for food and shelter.\nTheir movement is slow and gradual, with a distinctive undulating motion of their fins.\nAnemone fish are commonly found in tropical waters, particularly in coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific region.\nDue to their colorful appearance and association with the popular character Nemo from the movie Finding Nemo, anemone fish are a popular attraction for divers and aquarium enthusiasts."
