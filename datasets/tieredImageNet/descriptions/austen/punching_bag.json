                "content": "A punching bag is a large, cylindrical object that is suspended from a ceiling or free-standing structure and is designed to be struck repeatedly as part of a training or fitness regime. It is typically made of either leather or synthetic materials and can come in a range of colors, including red, black, and blue. The bag's exterior surface may have a rough texture to provide resistance and avoid damage from repeated strikes. The shape of the bag is often elongated and flares out towards the bottom where it is attached to a base or anchor. Punching bags are commonly found in gymnasiums, martial arts studios, and recreational centers for use in exercise and combat training."
