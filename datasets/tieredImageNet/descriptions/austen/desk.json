It is usually rectangular in shape and has a flat surface that is elevated off the ground. A desk can be made of wood, metal, or other materials and may have drawers or shelves for storage. The color of a desk can vary widely, but it is often a neutral tone. The texture of a desk may be smooth or slightly textured, depending on the material it is made from. Desks can be found in a variety of contexts, including classrooms, libraries, and homes."
