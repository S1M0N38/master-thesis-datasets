It is commonly known as hobblebush due to its low growth habit and tendency for its branches to grow horizontally forming barriers. The shrub can grow up to 3-4 meters in height and has leaves that are elliptical and serrated with fine hairs on the underside. Viburnum lantanoides produces flowers that are white and flat-topped, up to 15 centimeters in diameter. It typically blooms from May to June, and its fruit is a red berry that matures in late summer. The shrub is commonly found in the understory of forests and along streams and can be used in landscaping as a border or groundcover plant."
