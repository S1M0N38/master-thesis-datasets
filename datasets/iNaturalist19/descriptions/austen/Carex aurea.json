Its leaves are long and narrow, varying in color from yellowish-green to golden-brown. The stem of a Carex aurea is triangular and stiff, and can grow up to 60 cm in height. It typically grows in clumps and forms dense, spreading mats. This grass is found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, and is often used for erosion control or as a landscaping plant. Carex aurea has also been used for medicinal purposes in traditional medicine, though modern research is ongoing. Overall, Carex aurea is a striking plant with distinct visual characteristics that make it easily identifiable."
