The thorax is covered in dense, golden-orange hair giving it a fuzzy texture. The wings are transparent and veined, allowing for easy flight. Males are smaller than females and have longer antennae. Bombus sonorus can be found in a variety of habitats including forests, fields, and gardens. They are important pollinators for many flowering plants and crops. Despite their buzzy name, they are not known for being particularly noisy."
