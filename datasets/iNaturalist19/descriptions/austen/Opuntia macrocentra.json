It is also commonly known as Black-spined or Purple-spined Prickly Pear. The Opuntia macrocentra features oval-shaped pads with dark green to purple-black skin. It is adorned with clusters of long, sharp, black spines and small, glochid-covered bumps. The pads are covered with a layer of fine, white fuzz and blooms with large yellow or pink flowers in the spring. The fruits are round, reddish-purple, and edible. Opuntia macrocentra is found in hot, arid environments and can be used in landscaping for its striking visual appeal or harvested for its fruits, which have medicinal properties."
