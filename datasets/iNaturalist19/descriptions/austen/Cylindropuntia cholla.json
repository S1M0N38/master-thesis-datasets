It is a spiky, cylindrical cactus with numerous branches that are covered in dense clusters of spines. The spines are yellowish or reddish-brown in color, and range in length from very short to up to two inches long. The cactus can grow up to 15 feet tall and 6 feet wide, and has a woody, textured exterior. Cylindropuntia cholla are found in hot, desert climates and are often seen in arid landscapes such as the Sonoran Desert. The cactus is valued for its striking appearance, and is sometimes used for landscaping or as an ornamental plant. It is also used for medicinal purposes by some Native American tribes."
