It has a woody stem that reaches up to four meters in height and is topped with a cluster of long, pointed leaves that are green in color and have a leathery texture. The leaves of Yucca rupicola are stiff and sword-shaped, and are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant also produces a tall and slender flowering stalk that can reach up to six meters in height and bears clusters of creamy-white, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are followed by a round fruit that contains black seeds. The Yucca rupicola is often used for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes due to its striking appearance."
