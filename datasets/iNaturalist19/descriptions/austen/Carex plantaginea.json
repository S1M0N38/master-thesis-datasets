It typically grows to be around 8-12 inches tall and has a mounding habit. The leaves of the plant are green with a glossy texture and grow up to 12 inches long. The flowers of this species are small and appear in early spring, with light brown color. The rhizomatous roots of Carex plantaginea spread quickly, making it an excellent ground cover for shady areas. This plant is commonly found in wooded areas, rocky slopes, and along stream banks. Its unique visual characteristics, which include its glossy leaves and mounding shape, make it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping projects."
