The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval in shape and around 1-2cm long. The leaves are typically green or grey-green in color and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with stems that can reach up to 40cm in length. Trifolium subterraneum is a common component of pastures in many parts of the world and is particularly well-suited to dry, sandy soils. It is also used as a source of forage for livestock and as a cover crop to protect soil from erosion. Overall, the plant has a delicate and unobtrusive appearance, but it plays an important ecological role in many environments."
