It is commonly known as the 'longleaf pine' due to its long needles that grow up to 18 inches in length. The tree has a conical shape and can grow up to 100 feet in height. Its bark is thick and scaly, with a reddish-brown color. The 'Pinus palustris' is found in the southeastern parts of the United States, mainly in sandy soils and wet areas such as swamps and bogs. The tree has economic and ecological importance, as it is used for timber and plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecosystem. The needles of the longleaf pine are dark green and glossy, while the cones are large and woody, measuring up to 10 inches in length."
