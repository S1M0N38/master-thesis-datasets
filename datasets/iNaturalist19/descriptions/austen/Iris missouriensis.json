The plant is native to the central and western parts of North America. The flowers of the Iris missouriensis are typically blue-violet in color, with six petals arranged in a fan-like shape. The flowers also have a distinctive yellow stripe on the falls. The leaves of the plant are long and narrow, with a grass-like texture. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, along streambanks, and in other areas with moist soil. Iris missouriensis has been used in traditional Native American medicine to treat a range of ailments, from snake bites to stomach problems. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening as well."
