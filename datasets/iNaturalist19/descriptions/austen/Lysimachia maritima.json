The stem is erect and smooth, and the leaves are lanceolate and opposite. The flowers are small, yellow, and star-shaped, clustered in racemes, and bloom from summer to fall. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. The plant is commonly found in sandy or muddy shores, cliffs, and salt marshes in coastal regions. It's often used in horticulture as a ground cover or border plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
