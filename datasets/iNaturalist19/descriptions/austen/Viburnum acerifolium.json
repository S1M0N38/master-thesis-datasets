The plant typically grows up to 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide, with branches that are slender and slightly arching. The leaves of a Viburnum acerifolium are maple-shaped, with a dull greenish-gray color on the upper surface and a pale whitish color on the underside. The plant produces clusters of mildly fragrant, white or pink small flowers that bloom in early summer. The fruit of a Viburnum acerifolium are small, round, and red drupes that attract birds and other wildlife. The plant is mildly drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining, acidic soil conditions. Viburnum acerifolium is commonly used in landscaping and can be found in wooded areas, along roadsides, and in naturalized gardens."
