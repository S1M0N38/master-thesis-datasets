It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is commonly known as \"mile-a-minute vine\" due to its rapid growth rate. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually a vibrant green color with prominent veins. The flowers of Ipomoea cairica are funnel-shaped and range in color from pale pink to lavender or purple. They have a distinctive white or yellow throat and are approximately 5 cm in diameter. The vine typically grows along sandy or rocky shorelines but can also be found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It has a wiry stem and a delicate, yet invasive, nature.\""
