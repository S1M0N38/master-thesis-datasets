The leaves are oblong or lanceolate and grow opposite each other on the stem. They are dark green and glossy, with a slightly pubescent texture. The flowers are small and pinkish-purple, borne in clusters at the top of the stem. The seed pods are slender and elongate, with a pointed tip. Asclepias amplexicaulis is commonly found in prairies, meadows and open woods in central and eastern North America. Its unique visual characteristics make it a popular garden plant and attractor of pollinators."
