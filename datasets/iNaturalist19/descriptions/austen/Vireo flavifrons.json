The bird has a rounded body shape with a stubby tail and short legs. The top of its head, back, and wings are a grayish-green color, while its underbelly is white. The bird has a noticeable black and white eye stripe that runs across its face. It can be found in deciduous forests in North and Central America during the breeding season. Its song is a series of whistled phrases that are easily recognizable to birdwatchers."
