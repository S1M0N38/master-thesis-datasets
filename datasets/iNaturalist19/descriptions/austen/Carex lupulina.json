The plant is characterized by its deep green, narrow leaves that grow to around 40 cm in height, and its upright, triangular stems that can reach up to a meter tall. The inflorescence of Carex lupulina consists of small, pale brown or green spikes that bloom between May and July. The plant is a food source for wildlife and has been used in traditional medicine for its antispasmodic and diuretic properties. The texture of the leaves is smooth and grass-like, while the stem is rigid and has a rough surface due to small bumps or ridges. The overall appearance of Carex lupulina is dense and bushy, forming large clumps in the wetland habitats where it thrives."
