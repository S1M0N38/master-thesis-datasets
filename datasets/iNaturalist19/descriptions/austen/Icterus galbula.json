                "content": "\"Icterus galbula\" is the scientific name for the common yellowthroat, a small passerine bird found primarily in North America. It typically measures up to 12 cm in length and weighs around 9-13 grams. The male of the species has a distinctive black mask on its head and yellow throat, while the female has a more muted olive-green coloration. The wings and back of the bird are olive-green, while the breast and belly are a bright yellow. The beak is thin and pointed, with a slight downward curve. The habitat of the common yellowthroat includes wetlands, brushy areas, and other habitats with dense vegetation. The bird is known for its distinct \"witchety-witchety\" call, which is often heard during breeding season."
