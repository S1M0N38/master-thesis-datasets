                "content": "Lupinus polyphyllus is a perennial herbaceous plant commonly known as large-leaved lupine. Its tall and spiky flower stems can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The flowers are densely packed, with a range of colors including blue, purple, pink, and white. The leaves are palmate with 5-11 leaflets and covered in fine hairs giving them a soft texture. Lupinus polyphyllus prefers growing in moist habitats such as meadows, slopes, and woodlands. The plant is often used in horticulture for its attractive flowers and as a food source for livestock. Additionally, Lupinus polyphyllus is a significant plant in traditional Native American medicine due to its pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties."
