It has a multistemmed growth habit and can grow up to 10 feet tall. The leaves are simple, alternate, and lobed. The flowers are bright pinkish-red and hang in a raceme or drooping cluster. The fruit is a small red or black berry. The bark is grayish-brown and smooth with shallow crinkles. Ribes sanguineum is often used ornamentally in gardens or as a hedgerow plant, and provides nectar for hummingbirds and other pollinators. It is also used in herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
