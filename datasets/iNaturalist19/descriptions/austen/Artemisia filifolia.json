The leaves of the plant are very fine, feathery and disperse, and they have a silver-green color. The branches of the shrub are numerous and slightly twisted, forming a bushy structure. The flowers are yellow and grouped in inflorescences at the ends of the branches. The plant is used as a medicinal herb by some Native American tribes, and it is also important to the ecology of the Great Plains of North America. Artemisia filifolia can be found in arid regions, such as deserts, prairies and savannas."
