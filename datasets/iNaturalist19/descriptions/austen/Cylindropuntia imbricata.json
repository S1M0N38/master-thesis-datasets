The segments are green and may have a waxy texture. Each segment has a pair of small, curved spines. The cactus can grow up to 3 meters tall. It produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by reddish-purple fruit. Cylindropuntia imbricata is commonly found in arid regions, such as deserts and scrublands. It is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
