It often grows in dry, sandy soils and blooms in the spring or summer. The plant produces a single, erect stem topped by a single, large, showy flower. The petals of the flower are typically white, pink, or purple with prominent yellow hairs near the base. The plant's foliage is grass-like and typically reaches a height of 12 to 30 inches. It is often used in horticulture and can be found in gardens, meadows, and other natural settings. The Mariposa Lily is considered to be a symbol of beauty and resilience in some Native American cultures."
