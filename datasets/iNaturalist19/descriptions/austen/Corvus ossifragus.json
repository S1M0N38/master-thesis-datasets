                "content": "A 'Corvus ossifragus' is a species of bird commonly known as the Fish Crow. It has a glossy, black appearance with a slightly smaller body size than the American Crow. The Fish Crow has a distinctive nasal call that can help in identifying the species. Its wingspan ranges from 14-18 inches and it weighs between 6-8 ounces. Fish Crows can be found along coastal regions from Maine to Texas and some inland areas. They are scavengers and feed on a variety of food, including fish, fruits, and insects. Their breeding season typically begins in March and extends through July, with nests situated in trees or man-made structures."
