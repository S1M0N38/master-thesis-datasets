                "content": "Quercus agrifolia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a large evergreen tree found in California and Mexico. The tree can grow up to 82 feet tall and has a wide, spreading canopy. The bark of the Quercus agrifolia is dark gray and deeply furrowed. The leaves are leathery and dark green in color, with a glossy texture and spiny edges. The tree produces small, acorn fruit, which are a crucial food source for local wildlife such as squirrels and woodpeckers. The Quercus agrifolia is a prominent feature of many California landscapes, including coastal forests, canyons and hillsides. The tree is considered a keystone species, providing important ecological functions such as shelter and habitat for a diverse array of wildlife."
