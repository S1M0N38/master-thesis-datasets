                "content": "Pinus contorta, also known as lodgepole pine, is a species of tree in the pine family. It typically reaches 20-30 meters tall and has a narrow, cylindrical shape with a straight trunk. The bark is thin and scaly, initially dark gray or brown before turning to a reddish-brown color. The needles are long and slender, with a blue-green color and grow in clusters of two. The cones are small, oval-shaped, and serotinous, meaning they remain closed until exposed to heat, which opens them to release their seeds. Pinus contorta is found in a variety of habitats, including forests, meadows, and mountain slopes, in western North America, from Alaska to California. It is used for lumber, paper pulp, and as a source of resin and turpentine. It is also a popular tree for reforestation projects due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
