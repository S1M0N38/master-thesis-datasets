The leaves are slender and elongated, measuring up to five inches in length, and are arranged alternately on the stem. The flowers of Asclepias asperula are small and inconspicuous, with greenish-yellow petals and a distinctive scent that attracts pollinators. The plant produces long, narrow seed pods that split open to release their seeds in late summer. Asclepias asperula is commonly found in dry, rocky areas and along roadsides, and is often used for erosion control and wildlife habitat enhancement. Its visual characteristics include slender stems, elongated leaves, small greenish-yellow flowers, and long, narrow seed pods."
