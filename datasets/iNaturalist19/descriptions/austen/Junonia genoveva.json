This small butterfly has a wingspan of around 5-7 cm, with a distinctive brownish-orange coloration along the edges of its wings. The upper surface of its wings displays intricate patterns of black, white, and orange, while the undersides are a mottled shade of brown with darker spots. The texture of its wings is slightly rough, with a thin layer of scales covering the surface. Junonia genoveva typically inhabits coastal areas and mangrove swamps, with a diet consisting of nectar from flowers such as Lantana and Lippia. It is a relatively common species and is popular among butterfly enthusiasts for its striking colors and patterns."
