The flowers are bowl-shaped and are typically light pink to purple in color with a yellow center. The flower petals are smooth and velvety to the touch. Calochortus catalinae is found in coastal prairies and canyons of California and is often used in landscaping or as a cut flower. The plant is also considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-harvesting for horticultural purposes."
