It is a perennial herb that typically grows up to 2 feet tall. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and gray-green in color with a somewhat leathery texture. The flowers are small and usually pinkish or white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The fruit is a slender, elongated pod filled with silky, white seeds. Asclepias subulata can be found in arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States, particularly in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts. The plant is an important source of nectar for pollinators, such as butterflies and bees, and it is also used in traditional medicine for a variety of ailments."
