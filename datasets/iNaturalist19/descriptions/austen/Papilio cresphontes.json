The wingspan of a Papilio cresphontes can range from 4 to 6 inches. The wings are mostly black with pale yellow bands, and the hindwings have a long tail-like extension. The body of a Papilio cresphontes is black with white spots and has a fuzzy texture. These butterflies are widely distributed throughout the southern and eastern United States, Central America, and northern South America. They can be found in a variety of habitats, including gardens, fields, and forests. Upon hatching, the larvae of a Papilio cresphontes resemble bird droppings, which serves as camouflage."
