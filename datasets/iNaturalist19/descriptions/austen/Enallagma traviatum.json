Its wings are translucent with thin black veins and span around 25-30mm in length. The male and female have different coloration, with the males being primarily dark blue-grey with black markings and the females mainly brown with green and tan accents. Enallagma traviatum can be found near slow-moving streams, ponds, and lakes in woodland areas. They are active during the summer months and feed on small flying insects."
