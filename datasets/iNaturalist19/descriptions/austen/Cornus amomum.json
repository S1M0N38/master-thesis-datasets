It is commonly known as silky dogwood due to its fine hairs that cover the twigs, leaves and fruit. The shrub can reach a height of 10 feet and has a spreading growth habit. Its leaves are oval-shaped, dark green, and turn reddish-purple in the fall. The flowers are small and white, occurring in clusters in the spring, followed by clusters of blue-black berries in the summer. Cornus amomum is commonly found in wet areas such as banks of streams, ponds, and swamps, but it can also be used in landscaping as a border or mass planting. Its bark, roots, and leaves are used for medicinal purposes in traditional medicines."
