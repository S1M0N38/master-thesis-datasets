                "content": "A 'Prunus emarginata', also known as the Oregon cherry, is a small deciduous tree or large shrub. The bark is reddish-brown and smooth, developing shallow cracks as it ages. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and oval in shape, with serrated edges and a pointed tip. The flowers are white to pinkish and bell-shaped, appearing in clusters in early spring. The fruit is a small red cherry, around half an inch in diameter, with a slightly bitter taste. 'Prunus emarginata' typically grows in moist forests, along streams, and in rocky areas throughout western North America. Its beauty and fruit production make it a popular ornamental tree in gardens."
