                "content": "A Solanum pseudocapsicum, commonly known as the Jerusalem Cherry, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It typically grows up to 2 feet tall and produces small, round fruits resembling cherry tomatoes. The fruit is bright red or orange when ripe and has a smooth, shiny texture. The leaves of the plant are dark green and oval-shaped with a slightly wavy edge. The stem is woody and has a brownish-gray color, with small hairs on the surface. The Jerusalem Cherry is often used as an ornamental plant and is commonly found in gardens and as a decoration during the winter holiday season. However, the fruits contain solanine, a toxic alkaloid, and should not be consumed."
