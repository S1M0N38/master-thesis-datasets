                "content": "Pinus strobus, commonly known as the eastern white pine, is a species of pine tree found primarily in eastern North America. Its cylindrical trunk can grow up to 80 feet tall, with a diameter of up to 3 feet. The bark is grayish-brown and smooth when young, but becomes thick with large, irregular scales as it ages. The needles are arranged in bundles of five, are green-blue in color and can grow up to 5 inches long. The cones are long and slender, ranging from 4-8 inches in length and mature in the fall. Eastern white pines are commonly used in landscaping and timber harvesting, and they are also a popular Christmas tree species. They are known for their soft, lightweight wood and their ability to tolerate a variety of soil and climate conditions."
