                "content": "Cornus rugosa is a species of flowering shrub, commonly known as roundleaf dogwood. \nIt typically reaches heights of 1-3 meters and spreads through suckering to form clonal colonies. \nThe leaves are oval-shaped, up to 12 cm long, and have a rough surface texture. \nThe shrub produces clusters of small, creamy-white flowers in the spring, which give way to small, blue-black berries in the summer. \nThe bark is gray-brown and develops a scaly texture as the plant ages. \nRoundleaf dogwood is commonly found growing in wetland areas, such as marshes, fens, and along streams. \nThe plant is a popular landscaping choice due to its attractive foliage, showy blooms, and ability to attract wildlife."
