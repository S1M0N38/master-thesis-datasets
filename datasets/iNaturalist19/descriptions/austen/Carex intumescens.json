It is commonly known as the Greater Bladder Sedge due to the enlarged utricles it produces. The plant can grow to a height of 60-120 cm in living condition, and it has linear, smooth, and cylindrical stems that are triangular in cross-section. The leaves of Carex Intumescens are long and narrow, with a shiny green color and a rough texture. The fruiting heads of the plant are green or reddish-brown, and they have overlapping scales with prominent midribs. It is commonly found in wet habitats such as fens, marshes, swamps, and wet meadows. The Greater Bladder Sedge is an important part of wetland ecosystems as it provides food and habitat for various species of birds and insects."
