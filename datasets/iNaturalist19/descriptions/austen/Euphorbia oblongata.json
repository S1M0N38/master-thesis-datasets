                "content": "Euphorbia oblongata is a type of succulent plant that is native to parts of South Africa. It derives its name from the oblong-shaped leaves that grow on its stem. The plant has green stems and leaves with a waxy texture. Its leaves are arranged in pairs along the stem with each pair at right angles to the last. Euphorbia oblongata produces small, yellow-green flowers that grow in clusters. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant, and can also be found in natural habitats such as rocky outcrops and hillsides. The plant is hardy and resistant to drought, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
