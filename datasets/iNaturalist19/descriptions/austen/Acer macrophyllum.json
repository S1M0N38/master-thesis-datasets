The tree is known for its large, broad leaves which can measure up to 12 inches in diameter. These leaves are dark green in color with a thick, leathery texture. The acer macrophyllum tree can reach heights of 100 feet and have a trunk diameter of up to 5 feet. Its bark is grayish-brown and marked with vertical furrows. The tree blooms in the spring with small, yellow-green flowers that grow in clusters. The bigleaf maple is commonly found in Pacific Northwest forests, from southern Alaska to southern California. It is often used as a shade tree in urban areas and is also valued for its wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments."
