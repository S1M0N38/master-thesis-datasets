It can grow up to 82 feet tall and has a trunk diameter of up to 3 feet. The bark of the tree is dark brown, rough and deeply furrowed. The leaves are large, glossy green in color, and can measure up to 9 inches long. The acorns are also large, measuring up to 1 inch in length, and have a distinctive cap that encloses up to 1/3 of the nut.
