Its leaves are long and narrow, with a bright green color and a smooth texture. The plant can grow up to 1.2 m tall and its stems are woody at the base. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Tarragon has a distinctive herbal aroma and a slightly bittersweet taste. It is widely used in French cuisine as a seasoning for meat, fish, sauces, and vinegar. It can be found growing in gardens, farms, and nurseries, as well as in spice racks in kitchens and restaurants around the world."
