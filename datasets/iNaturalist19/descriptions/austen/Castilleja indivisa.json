                "content": "A Castilleja indivisa, also known as Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to North America. The slender stems grow up to 2 feet tall and are covered with small green leaves. The flowers are clustered at the tip of the stem in a bright red to orange inflorescence, resembling a paintbrush dipped in vibrant hues. The flowers have a tubular shape, with a green-yellowish to white interior and are about 1 inch long. Indian paintbrush is commonly found in open meadows, prairies, and rocky slopes at elevations of up to 8000 feet. Its stunning and unique coloration and shape make it a popular subject for photographers and a beloved symbol of the West."
