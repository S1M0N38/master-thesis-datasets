Its bark is dark gray and deeply fissured, revealing lighter brown wood underneath. The leaves are small, oval-shaped, and dark green, with a leathery texture. The acorns are also small, round, and have a distinctive cap that covers about one-third of the nut. The interior live oak can grow up to 50 feet tall and has a broad, spreading canopy that provides good shade. This species is commonly found in coastal and foothill regions of California, and plays an important ecological role in supporting a variety of bird and insect species. The wood of the Quercus wislizeni is highly sought after by furniture makers due to its durability and attractive grain pattern."
