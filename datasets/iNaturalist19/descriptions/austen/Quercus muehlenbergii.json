It is native to North America, specifically found in the Eastern and Central United States. The Chinkapin oak has an average height of 40-60 feet and a spread of 30-40 feet. The bark is gray and develops deep fissures as the tree ages. The leaves are dark green and glossy, with shallow lobes that resemble the shape of a Chinkapin nut. The acorns produced by the Quercus muehlenbergii are small and have a sweet kernel. This species of oak is commonly found in woodlands and savannahs, and is often used for ornamental purposes in landscaping due to its attractive appearance."
