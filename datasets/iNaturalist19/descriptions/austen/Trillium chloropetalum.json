It is commonly known as \"Giant Wakerobin\" or \"Western Trillium.\" The plant can grow up to 1 m in height and has three large, ovate leaves that are around 10-30 cm long. The flowers are white to pink in color and have three petals that are reflexed and pointed. The flowers bloom during the spring and are about 6-10 cm wide. Trillium chloropetalum is found in moist, shaded areas of wooded regions, especially in coastal forests, and it prefers rich, well-drained soils. The plant is sometimes used for medicinal purposes, as it contains antimicrobial agents and has been used traditionally to treat infections. It is also a popular ornamental plant for shade gardens."
