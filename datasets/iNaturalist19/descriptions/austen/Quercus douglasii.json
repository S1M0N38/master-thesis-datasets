Its leaves are green or grayish-green and are shaped like a cross or an irregular star. The acorns are round and sit in a shallow cup in the branches. The bark of Quercus douglasii is deeply furrowed and rough to the touch. The tree can grow up to 80 feet tall and usually has a broad, spreading crown. This species of oak is found in dry, rocky terrain throughout California and southwestern Oregon. It is commonly used for firewood and in landscaping."
