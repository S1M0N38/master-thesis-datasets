It is commonly known as the bunny ear cactus due to its distinctive flattened pads which resemble bunny ears. The pads are oval-shaped and covered in small clusters of fuzzy, golden spines called glochids. The cactus can grow up to 2 feet tall and needs full sun to thrive. It produces bright yellow flowers in the summer that bloom for a single day. Opuntia microdasys is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant and is often used in xeriscaping. It is also used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
