The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall with a trunk diameter of 40 centimeters. The needles of the Pinus monophylla are solitary and 4-6 cm long, green to blue-green in color and twisted. The bark of the tree is thick and scaly, ranging from gray-brown to orange-brown in color. The cones of the tree are small and oval-shaped, measuring 3 to 7 cm long and containing edible pine nuts. Pinus monophylla is commonly found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, especially in the Great Basin and Mojave Desert regions of the United States."
