It is known for its clusters of small, fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. The stems are covered in curved, sharp thorns. The leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with five to nine leaflets. The plant can grow up to 12 feet tall and 15 feet wide, creating dense thickets. Rosa multiflora is commonly found in gardens and hedgerows, as well as in natural areas such as forests and meadows. It is used for its ornamental value and it is also cultivated for its fruit, which can be made into jams and jellies."
