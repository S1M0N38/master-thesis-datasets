The leaves are oval in shape, pointed, and dark green. White, fragrant flowers bloom in clusters in late spring, followed by clusters of pink berries that mature to a blue-black color. The bark is gray-brown and deeply grooved. Viburnum nudum is commonly used in ornamental landscaping and can be found in gardens, parks, and natural areas. Its berries are also a food source for a variety of bird species."
