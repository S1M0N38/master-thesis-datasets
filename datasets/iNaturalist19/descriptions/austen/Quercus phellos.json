The bark of Quercus phellos is smooth, pale gray, and develops shallow fissures as it ages. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive narrow shape with a pointed end. They are dark green on the upper surface and pale green on the undersurface. The acorns of Quercus phellos are small, round, and have a saucer-like cap that covers less than half of the nut. This tree species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can be found in forests, woodlands, and along streams or other bodies of water. In summation, Quercus phellos is a tall, narrow oak tree with smooth pale gray bark, dark green narrow leaves, and small round acorns with a saucer-like cap, often found in moist, well-drained soils in North America."
