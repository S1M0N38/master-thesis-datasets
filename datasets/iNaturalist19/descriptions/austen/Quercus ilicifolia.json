                "content": "Quercus ilicifolia, commonly known as bear oak, is a small deciduous tree that grows up to 10 meters tall. The bark of the tree is grayish brown with deeply furrowed ridges. The leaves have a glossy dark green upper surface with a lighter underside and are characterized by their holly-like spines. The acorns produced by the bear oak are small and oval-shaped with shallow cupules. The tree's growth rate is slow to moderate. Bear oak is commonly found in dry, rocky upland forests and woodlands throughout the eastern United States. It is often used for erosion control and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
