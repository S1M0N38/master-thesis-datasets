It is native to North America, particularly in the eastern and central regions of the United States. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a whorled fashion along the stem. It produces clumps of small, white flowers with pink or purple accents, which bloom in late spring or early summer. The flowers are followed by slender seedpods that split open to release silky-haired seeds. Whorled milkweed is commonly found growing in prairies, meadows, and along roadsides, and is an important source of nectar for several species of butterflies and moths. Its visual characteristics include a delicate and airy appearance, with finely-textured leaves and small, elegant flowers that contrast distinctly against the dark green stems and leaves."
