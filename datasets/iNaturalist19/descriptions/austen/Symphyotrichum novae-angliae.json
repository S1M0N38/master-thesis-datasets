Each flower has a yellow center that is surrounded by numerous ray petals. The plant is found in moist meadows, fields, and along streams throughout the northeastern region of North America. It blooms from late summer through fall and provides an important source of nectar for bees and butterflies. The New England aster has become a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes due to its striking beauty and ability to attract pollinators."
