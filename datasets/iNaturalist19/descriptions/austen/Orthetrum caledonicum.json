Its body is long and slender, covered in blue-green or bronze metallic scales that shimmer in the sunlight. The eyes are large and encircle most of the head, with a deep blue or brown color. The wings are transparent with a slight blue or yellow tint, and the veins are outlined in black. Male Orthetrum caledonicum have a slightly wider abdomen than females and a pair of claspers at the end. They can be found near freshwater lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The Blue Skimmer Dragonfly is a great flier that can hover and fly backwards, making it a joy to watch in flight. It hunts small insects and other prey using its sharp mandibles, which it uses to catch and crush its prey."
