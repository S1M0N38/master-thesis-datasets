                "content": "Bombus bimaculatus is a species of bumblebee found in North America. It is approximately 1.0 to 1.5 cm in length with black and yellow or white striping on its thorax and abdomen. It has two distinctive yellow spots on its head, between and above its antennae. The wings are translucent with brown veins, and the legs are covered in black hairs. Bombus bimaculatus can be found in a variety of habitats, including fields, forests, and gardens. It plays an important role in pollinating a wide range of plants, including berries, tomatoes, and clovers. In some areas, Bombus bimaculatus populations have declined due to habitat loss and pesticide use."
