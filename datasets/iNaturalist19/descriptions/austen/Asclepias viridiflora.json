The flowers of Asclepias viridiflora are small, with greenish-yellow petals that are fused together to form a five-pointed star-shaped corolla. The leaves are narrow and elongated, with a green color that is slightly glossy and a smooth texture. The stems are also green and have a slightly fuzzy texture. Asclepias viridiflora typically grows in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides in the eastern United States. It is commonly used as a food source for monarch butterfly larvae, making it an important plant for conservation efforts aimed at preserving this species."
