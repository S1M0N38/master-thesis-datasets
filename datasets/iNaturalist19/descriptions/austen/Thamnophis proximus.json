The snake has a slender and elongated body that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The dorsal side of the snake's body has a distinct combination of black, brown, and olive-green stripes, which form a pattern resembling a ribbon. The ventral side of the body is usually lighter in color. The scales are smooth and shiny, giving the snake a sleek appearance. 'Thamnophis proximus' is often found near streams, rivers, and wetlands, and is particularly fond of areas with dense vegetation.
