                "content": "Quercus alba, commonly known as the white oak, is a species of oak tree found in North America. It is characterized by its large size, reaching heights up to 100 feet and having a trunk diameter of up to 6 feet. The bark of the tree is grayish-white and becomes rough and scaly with age. The leaves are broad and lobed, with a deep green color on the top and a lighter green color underneath. In the fall, the leaves turn a rich brownish-red color. The acorns of the white oak are large and round, measuring about 1 inch in diameter. The wood of the white oak is highly valued for its strength and durability, and is commonly used in construction and furniture-making. The white oak tree is commonly found in forests, but can also be planted as part of landscaping in parks and residential areas."
