                "content": "Viburnum dentatum is a deciduous shrub species native to North America. It is commonly known as arrowwood due to the use of its straight stems by Native Americans to make arrow shafts. The shrub can grow up to 10 feet tall and wide, with a dense and rounded shape. Its bark is greyish-brown and smooth when young, becoming rough and plated with age. The leaves are opposite, dark green and glossy, and have a serrated edge. In the fall, the foliage turns yellow to red. The plant produces white, flat-topped flowers in late spring that are followed by blue-black berries in the fall, which are attractive to birds. Viburnum dentatum is commonly used in landscaping as a hedge, screen, or as a specimen plant in gardens and parks."
