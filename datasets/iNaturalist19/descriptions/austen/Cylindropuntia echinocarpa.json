                "content": "A Cylindropuntia echinocarpa is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly known as the golden cholla due to its yellow-green color. The plant's stem consists of cylindrical joints covered in golden spines, giving it a textured appearance. The joints are typically 10-20 cm in length and 2-4 cm in diameter. During the spring, the plant produces small, yellow flowers which attract pollinators such as bees. The Cylindropuntia echinocarpa is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, and is adapted to thrive in conditions of high heat and low water availability. Due to its distinctive appearance, it is often used as an ornamental plant in landscaping."
