The leaves of Anemone ranunculoides are deeply divided and have a slightly hairy texture. This species is commonly found in deciduous woods and damp meadows throughout central and southern Europe. Anemone ranunculoides is used in traditional herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties and to treat various ailments. In the garden, it is often planted as a ground cover and naturalizer due to its spreading habit."
