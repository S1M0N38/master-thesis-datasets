                "content": "A 'Polistes annularis' is a species of paper wasp commonly found in North America. It has a slender, elongated body with a distinct waist and long legs. Its head is small with two large compound eyes and long antennae. The color of its body ranges from reddish-brown to dark brown with yellow bands around its abdomen. The wings are transparent with a slight yellow tint. This species is typically found building nests in residential areas, wooded areas, or fields. They are important pollinators and play a role in controlling pest populations. Polistes annularis are social insects, living in small colonies with a queen and female workers."
