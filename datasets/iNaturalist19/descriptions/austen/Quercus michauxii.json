It typically grows to a height of 15-20 meters, with a trunk diameter of 0.6-0.9 meters. The bark of Quercus michauxii is smooth and grayish-brown in color, and becomes furrowed with age. The leaves are simple, lobed, and green in color, with a glossy surface and a leathery texture. The tree produces acorns with a cup-like structure, which contain seeds that are an important food source for wildlife. Quercus michauxii is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi. It primarily grows in upland forests, and is often used for timber, firewood, and as a food source for wildlife."
