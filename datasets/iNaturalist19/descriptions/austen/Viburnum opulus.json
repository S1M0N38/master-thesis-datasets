The bark of the Viburnum opulus is grey-brown and the twigs are green and relatively slender. The leaves are lobed and dark green, with a serrated edge resembling a maple leaf. The flowers are white, with a diameter of 5-15 cm, and bloom from May to June. The fruit is a bright red, spherical drupe that is about 1 cm in diameter and mature in late summer. Viburnum opulus is a popular ornamental plant that is often used in garden design and for hedging. It can also be found growing wild in damp woods, hedgerows, and along rivers and streams."
