                "content": "Salvia greggii, commonly known as Autumn Sage, is a perennial plant species native to Texas and Mexico. It is a small, bushy shrub that grows up to 3 feet tall and 4 feet wide. The leaves of Salvia greggii are oval-shaped, pointed, and hairy to the touch. The flowers are small and tubular, typically ranging from pink to red in color, and bloom from late spring through fall. The plant requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, making it a popular choice for xeriscape gardens in arid regions. Salvia greggii is frequently used in landscaping, rock gardens, and as a border plant due to its vibrant color and low maintenance requirements."
