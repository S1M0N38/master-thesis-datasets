It typically grows to a height of 10-30 centimeters and has bright pink or lilac flowers with four petals. The leaves are deeply divided and resemble the shape of a bird's foot. The stem is long and slender with a slightly hairy texture. It can be found in wet meadows, ditches, and damp woodland across Europe and parts of Asia. In traditional medicine, the plant has been used to treat a variety of ailments, from scurvy to skin irritations. Its distinct appearance and nectar-rich flowers make it a valuable food source for pollinating insects."
