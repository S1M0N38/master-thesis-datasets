It has a wingspan of up to 150mm and is known for its distinctive multi-tailed hind wings. The upper side of its wings are black with greenish-yellow markings, while the undersides are brown with light yellow spots. The wings also have a slightly iridescent sheen. Its body is slender and a dark brown to black color, with some yellow markings on the thorax. It can often be found in tropical forests and gardens, and is a popular species among butterfly collectors. The Papilio multicaudata undergoes complete metamorphosis, going through egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. During the pupal stage, it forms a chrysalis that is green with gold spots."
