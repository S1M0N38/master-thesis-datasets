It has a distinctive three-leaf structure, each leaf being a slightly oval shape with a smooth texture. The leaves are a vibrant green color and can have a white edging. The flowers are small and white, often forming into a round-shaped cluster. At the base of each leaf stem, there is a small white or pink ball-shaped flower. Trifolium repens is commonly found in pastures, meadows, lawns, and roadsides. It is used for animal forage, as a natural nitrogen-fixer, and also in herbal remedies for its medicinal properties."
