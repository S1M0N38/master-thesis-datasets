                "content": "Acer platanoides, commonly known as the Norway maple, is a species of tree native to Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 25m in height. The bark of the tree is gray-brown in color and has shallow grooves. The leaves are lobed and veined, with a dark green color and a smooth texture. In the fall, the leaves turn a vibrant yellow-orange color. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring that develop into winged seeds called samaras. The Norway maple is commonly used in landscaping and as a street tree due to its attractive appearance and hardiness in urban environments. It can also be found in natural forest and woodland habitats."
