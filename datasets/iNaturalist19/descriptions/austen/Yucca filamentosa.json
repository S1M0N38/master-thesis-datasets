It is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves with curly filamentous threads along the margins. The plant can grow up to three feet tall and spread over an area of five feet wide. It features a trunkless rosette growth habit with green to bluish-green leaves. The plant's flowers are typically creamy white and bell-shaped, blooming during late spring and early summer. Yucca filamentosa is used in landscaping and gardening as a low maintenance ornamental plant, adding a unique texture and focal point to a garden or landscape. Its drought and heat tolerance, as well as its adaptability to a variety of soil types, make it a popular choice among gardeners."
