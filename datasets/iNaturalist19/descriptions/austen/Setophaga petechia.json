It has a vibrant yellow plumage with olive-green wings and tail. The males have reddish streaks on their breast, while females have a more washed-out coloration. The bill is thin, pointed, and black in color. Its eyes are black and surrounded by a white eyering. Setophaga petechia is commonly found in North and South America, in habitats such as forests, wetlands, and shrubby areas. It feeds mainly on insects and spiders and sings a distinctive song that sounds like \"sweet, sweet, sweet, I'm so sweet\". It is a migratory species, breeding in North America during the summer and heading to the tropics during the winter."
